# Piecewise curve approximation

Constructs a curve that has the best fit to a series of an ordered set of points. Four algorithms are implemented:

* Quad + Bezier curve fitting
* Smooth Fitting
* Least square fitting
* Polygon fitting

# Testing Mac

>> ./compile.sh

>> ./run.sh

# Testing Windows

>> compile.bat

>> run.bat

# Interaction 
Draw a set of points by holding the left click and moving around the application window. 
Once the mouse click is released the set of points is approximated by the selected algorithm. 

Toggle the selected algorithms with Ctrl + C.
